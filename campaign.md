# Traveller Campaign

Hello, friends! This campaign is a vehicle used to transport us into the far future. Together as Traveller players we will experience a small part of the vast and wondrous galaxy, its societies, cultures, and technology. In the span of just 12 sessions, plus a session zero (character creation, safety, etc.), we will finish a complete set of adventures which provide a slowly unfolding character drama not unlike a modern sci-fi tv show.

## Episodes

Each session is one episode of our show and it tells a complete story. It may take place over any length of time in our fictional universe, but it will only take up 4-5 hours of real time.

## Rules

We will use [Mongoose's Traveller, second edition](https://www.mongoosepublishing.com/collections/traveller-rpgs). I recommend you get a copy of the core rulebook for your reference. There is a free  [online SRD](https://www.traveller-srd.com/), if you don't mind taking a little ad damage. There will be a few noteworthy [house rules](house_rules.md), intended to streamline and simplify our experience at the table.

## The Setting

Interstellar travel is a reality. Starships, travelling much faster than light, carry merchandise, passengers, and  information from world to world, linking worlds separated by many parsecs into economic, political, and social  communities. The primary influence on the nature of interstellar society is the jump drive. Jump drive provides the means for starships to travel from star system to star system with comfort, ease, and speed. That speed is not instantaneous; each jump, regardless of the distance, takes about one week. Ships with large, heavy jump drives can jump up to six parsecs (approx. 20 light years) in a week, but when such a ship jumps just one parsec, the jump still takes one week. Smaller jump drives have a maximum jump of one or two parsecs and also take a week for each jump.

Electromagnetic radiation (radio, visible light, etc.) travels at the constant speed of one light-year in one standard. Communication can proceed faster using Ansible networks. Due to the considerable financial burden and technical limitations, Ansibles are typically installed only one to a system and then at the outer boundary of the gravity well. Ansibles are installed in pairs, interlaced into peer to peer networks using standard EM transmission for interpair signal. EM signals are also used to exchange messages with external clients - in system communication arrays, satellites, and nearby ships. Travellers within a few thousand kilometers of a platform can have real time interstellar communication. Messages are stored and forwarded when out of range.

The effect of limited superluminal travel/communication create a tiers. Interstellar communities find themselves in one of three categoies. Each cateogory tends to shape its communities with common characteristics.

1. **In Network:** Communities that are within proximity to an Ansible are the most informed. They receive both morning and evening news reports form across charted space. Financial accounts are accessible with confirmation of transfer within at most an hour or two and often much faster. Goods are carried in by all major shipping lines each week. Stores are rarely empty for more than a few days. The value of products can still be inflated by supply chain factors and speculators will always attempt to captialize when demand spikes or supply dips, but prices always return to normal. Intelligence preceeds any interstellar action, meaning threats are often known ahead of time. Communities can expect aid from allies in time to make a difference in any armed conflict.

1. **Sattelite:** When a community is within one or two parsecs of a neighbor who is in-network, its members are always a week or more behind current events.
