# Imperial Cluster

From his Archducal seat in the Ley Sector, newly appointed shipping tycoon Marcus Aaron Erechs pursues an aggressive strategy of economic expansion. His rule promises Imperial citizens renewed prosperity and opportunity.

For the people living on worlds in Gateway Sector, the Archduke and his promises are still distant news. His speeches are carried by the news  service but their impact is unclear to you. You might have an uncle who talks about The Emperor's secret plan to clean up the sector, get rid  of all these pirates and aliens, and fix his gout. You definitely have relatives and friends who warn you about the Imperium. You've probably been told The Imperium has agents in Gateway on covert missions. History books record the impact of their hubris and The Long Night is a cautionary tale everyone learns about in school. You were taught and may still believe that while the military might and technological advantage of the Imperium are undeniable, their system of government is barbaric. The idea of a ruling class whose claim is by blood just doesn't sit well with most citizens of Gateway Sector. You may even harbor a little moral superiority and hope that should it ever come to be that the Imperium tries to press their way onto the place you call home, somehow the resourcefulness and indominable spirit of the people of Gateway will prevail.
