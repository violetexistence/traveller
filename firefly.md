Right...we win.

We open on a devastating loss in the war. Mal has faith and hope. He is fighting on the losing side but it's the right side. The Independents surrender. The war is over.

Cut to a salvage operation. There is no sound in space. We hear radio squawks and tense commands as the crew proceeds to cut into the hull of a wrecked ship and retrieve the cargo. Chemicals are used to open the hatch. There are shabby looking vac suits. In zero-g, movement are slow, cautious, deliberate.

An Alliance Cruiser shows up on sensors, they are approaching fast. The crew all goes silent in hopes they will not be spotted. For a minute it looks like it's going to work, but suddenly the cruiser stops and deploys gunships. They've been had. They're "humped". The cant used by the crew includes little bits of jargon, like "shiny", but also mixes in what sounds like Chinese. The interior of Serenity is worn and industrial. We're looking at Star Wars here. Not Star Trek. The pilot wears a hawaiian shirt and keeps little toys on the console. This is a free trader vessel. Think south pacific in the 20s and 30s. 

They engage the "cry baby". Cut to what looks like a communications buoy, hand crafted from wires and duct tape. It goes hot where upon the cruiser immediately picks up a phony distress signal from an alleged transport ship that has lost power. The cruiser decides reluctantly they must abandon their pursuit and arrest of criminals to rescue the transport. We get a beautiful shot of Serenity performing a full burn in the getaway. Once again completely silent external shot of the ship and cascade of golden light from the aft of the ship. It looks like the phosphorescent abdomen of a, you guessed it, firefly.

Inside the cargo hold, we see a brief moment in the airlock with the crew still in their suits, and the crates recovered from the wreck are still floating in zero g. At some point the airlock is pressurized and at the same time, the crates falls to the deck. We have artificial gravity. It is never explained. This is good. Zero g costs $ to put on camera and we can't be doing that constantly. We've established we take physics seriously. It's the far future. We have solved this problem somehow.

The pilot's voice comes over the PA and announces the cruiser is not following. They have got away for now. That's fine by the crew. "Any one you can walk away from, right?" They gave the feds the slip. They kept the score. No one got hurt. "I'll call this a win!"

Mal isn't so thrilled. "Yeah...we win" It's the same face as when the orders came to lay down arms. It's clear it doesn't feel like victory to him.
