<dl>
    <dt>100D</dt>
    <dd>The 100-diameter limit. Refers to the distance from a gravity well required to safely operate a jump drive. D = the diameter of the body creating the gravity well.</dd>

    <dt>g-rating</dt>
    <dd>The limit of acceleration for which a ship's m-drive is rated, measured in gravitational force. 1*g* = about 9.8 m/s<super>2</super></dd>

    <dt>Jump Point</dt>
    <dd>The point at which a down jump or out jump is performed.</dd>

    <dt>Jump Line</dt>
    <dd>A line between origin and destination jump points, which comes no closer than 100D to any gravity well.</dd>

    <dt>Breakout Point</dt>
    <dd>The point on the jump line closest to your destination. This is your down jump point.</dd>
