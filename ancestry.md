# HUMANITI

All humans are known to be descended from stock originating on Terra. Most (but not all) humans can procreate sexually. Most human groups are cultural rather than (or as much as) genetic.

## MIXED ANCESTRY

The vast majority of humans are of mixed ancestry and may display the physical characteristics of any group famliar to us in the 21st century. Mixed ancestry humans may be of any cultural origin.

## JONKEEREEN

The Jonkeereen are a genetically modified group of humans designed for desert environments. They are uncommon found outside small enclaves on dry worlds, or occassionally traveling on business.

Jonkeereen are more or less identical in appearance to unmodified humans. They possess a second eyelid and numerous other small modifications to protect against airborne dust and bright desert sunlight.

## LURIANI

The Luriani are an amphibious human group, who originate from Daramm. It is believed they came to be there roughly 300,000 years ago, where they created mixed offspring with a purely acquatic group of humans. Today, Luriani are all amphibious and comprose the third largest group of humans in the region, second only to the Vilani and Solomani. The Luriani have long played an important part in the history and politics of the region - the former Archduke of the Gateway Domain was of Luriani ancestry. They show a predominance of right brained dominant traits, such as left handedness. Musical and other artistic talent is a common stereotype.

Luriani differ slightly from other human groups, in that they have webbed hands and feet, and other adaptations to an aquatic environment. These include a second eyelid, oily skin, a special subcutaneous later of fat (which gives them a  somewhat blubberous appearance compared to other humans), and bodies are able to withstand greater pressure (up to 25 atm) without ill effect.

For historical reasons, Luriani are often pro-Solomani and anti-Vilani, though sentiment for the modern Solomani Confederacy is generally unsympathetic.

Most Luriani live on a cluster of worlds around Daramm. However, they travel as widely as any other humans and are a common site anywhere in the region.

## SYDITES

Descendants from humans that once dominated a polity known as the Sydymic Empire. Two centuries ago, war with the Third Imperium destroyed their empire, forcing the Sydites to rebuild their society and technological infrastructure. Although most Sydites are encountered in the Delta Quandrant of Ley Sector, small enclaves exist throughout the Gateway Domain and surrounding areas.

The Khuur League, a loose knit trade federation, is the polity of present day Sydites. Their treaty with the Imperium precents them from posessing military forces of their own, thought individual member worlds are permitted defense forces. Today, the bulk of Khuurish force projection is in the form of armed merchant cruisers.

The Sydites are one of the most divergent of all the human groups. They show clear signes of genetic engineering, being very large (8 ft. tall on average) and posessing four arms. Sydites cannot procreate with other humans.

# AKEED

Native to the world of Akeen, they have built a multi-world state called the Akeena Union, in which many humans live happily as partners of the Akeed. Their human partners often describe Akeed as "lovably yucky" and get along well with them.

Akeed derive nourishment directly from the minerals found in soil and water. Their lower bodies are boneless, rather like the foot of a snail or slug, but more round. Their upper bodies contaiing their brains and other important organs, is also the base for two pairs of tentacles, one on each side, wich each end in four boneless fingers. They have a cartilaginous case that protects their head. Eyes are semi-extended on short and broad stalk/protectors from the sides of their head.

Akeed not not possess a sense of smell or taste, nor do they have a mouth as such, though their breathing hole can make intelligible sounds and they are excellent singers.

Akeed feed by drawing up nutrients from the soil though openeings at the base of their foot. They can propel themselves slowly through water by pulsing their foot, and much faster for short period by drawing in water and squirting it out under pressure. It is not known if Akeed can breathe water or if they absorb oxygen in their tissues in the same manner as Luriani, but they can remain submerged for long periods.

Akeed stand about 75cm high and can surge on their foot to a stable height of about 1.25 meters, and a little higher for short periods. They cannot move while surging up, however. Movement is slow; 4m per round. Akeed cannot traverse vertical surfaces, but can stick to steep slopes of up to 70ยบ so long as the surface is smooth, such as a starship hull and move
at 1m per round.

The upper body does possess a cartilaginous skeletal structure, plus bands of erectile tissue that allow the Akeed to bend of twist in any direction. While amazingly flexible, this structure is rather light, making the Akeed somewhat delicate compared to other vertabrate species.

Akeed are however very social. Humans find their damp, slimy appearance unpleasant at first, though their natural smell is rather pleasing to most humans. They prefer to settle disputes by means of long arguments that go on until someone admits defeat. They rarely allow a situation to deteriorate to the point of conflict, and most actual fighting done by the Union is undertaken by the human segment of the population.

Little is known about the Akeed socal of governmental apparatus. Most visitors to their worlds interact with humans for the most part. However, it is thought that the Akeed have underwater cities on their worlds, where millions or billions of Akeed reside in some harmonious way.
